# Exercise 2 - Running with a Persistent Database

## Goals

* Decouple database service from the application
* Run a MySQL database on Docker
* Learn about Docker persistent volumes and linking containers

## Acceptance Criteria

* Application configuration modified to connect to MySQL database
* Docker image is rebuilt and tagged as `pet-app`
* MySQL running in Docker
* Application running in Docker and linked to MySQL container
* Application can be accessed on http://localhost:8080
* New owner is created, with at least 1 pet
* Kill and restart application container
* Owner created in previous step is still available

## Step by Step Instructions

First of all we will create a `data` folder to use as the container persistent
volume, and then start an image of the MySQL 5.7 container and pass a few
environment variables to create a new database, user, and password:

```shell
$ mkdir data
$ docker run -d --name pet-db -v $PWD/data:/var/lib/mysql -e MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=yes -e MYSQL_DATABASE=petclinic -e MYSQL_USER=petclinic-user -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=S3cr3t mysql:5.7
```

Now we can start our application container, but this time enabling the `mysql`
Spring profile with an environment variable, and also adding the `--link` option
to connect to the MySQL container:

```shell
$ docker run --name=pet-app-prod -d -p 8080:8080 -e "SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=mysql" --link pet-db pet-app
ff776db53488ff18644bfd79e39f7101501dbfd4cc0216f041051a1155a8adaf
```

Then you should be able to access the application by going to http://localhost:8080.

Use the application to create a new owner with a pet. Then we can test that the
persistence is working by restarting the containers with `docker stop` and
`docker rm` commands.

After testing, stop and remove both containers to prepare for the next step.
